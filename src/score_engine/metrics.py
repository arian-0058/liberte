"""
Prometheus metrics for phaseÂ 2
==============================

This module centralises the definition of Prometheus metrics used by
both the ROI analyzer and scoring engine.  Defining all metrics in
one place simplifies both unit testing (by allowing metrics to be
replaced with dummies) and observability (by ensuring that all
metrics share the same namespace and lifecycle).

If the ``prometheus_client`` package is unavailable the metrics
variables are set to ``None``.  Code that updates metrics should
therefore test for ``None`` before calling methods on them.  This
approach avoids import errors when running in minimal environments.
